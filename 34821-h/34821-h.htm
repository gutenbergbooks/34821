<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Though they are never particularly edifying, literary quarrels may at
times be educative. Always savage, attacks on Pope reached their lowest
depths of scurrility in 1742, when, in addition to the usual prose and
doggerel verse pamphlets, engravings were being circulated portraying Pope
in a brothel&mdash;this on the basis of the story told in the notorious <i>Letter
from Mr. Cibber to Mr. Pope</i>, dated 7 July 1742.<small><a name="f1.1" id="f1.1" href="#f1">[1]</a></small> The Augustan Reprint
Society has already reissued three of the anonymous Grub Street attacks
made upon Pope in this busy year,<small><a name="f2.1" id="f2.1" href="#f2">[2]</a></small> but the present volume is intended to
complete the picture of the battle-lines by reprinting a verse attack
launched from the court&mdash;by Hervey presenting himself as Cibber&#8217;s
ally&mdash;and a verse defence that comes, in point of artistry, clearly from
or near Grub Street itself.</p>

<p>Lord Hervey&#8217;s verses, <i>The Difference between Verbal and Practical
Virtue</i>, were published between 21 and 24 August 1742, less than a week
after the same author&#8217;s prose pamphlet (<i>A Letter to Mr. C&mdash;b&mdash;r, On his
Letter to Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;.</i>) which had compared the art of Pope and Cibber to
Cibber&#8217;s advantage, and had roundly concluded that Pope was &#8220;<i>a
second-rate Poet</i>, a <i>bad Companion</i>, a <i>dangerous Acquaintance</i>, an
<i>inveterate, implacable Enemy</i>, <i>nobody&#8217;s Friend</i>, a <i>noxious Member of
Society</i>, and <i>a thorough bad Man</i>.&#8221; In the course of the prose pamphlet
Hervey had suggested that there was a certain incongruity between Pope&#8217;s
true character and his assumed <i>persona</i> of the &#8220;virtuous man,&#8221; and this
incongruity forms the main subject of his verse attack. Here Hervey finds
examples of &#8220;the difference between verbal and practical virtue&#8221; in the
lives of Horace, Seneca, and Sallust, before turning to lampoon Pope
crossly and ineptly. The attack on Horace is well conceived for Hervey&#8217;s
purpose and calculated to damage Pope who was in so many eyes, including
his own, the modern heir of that ancient poet, but the straight abuse
directed<span class="pagenum">[Pg ii]</span> against Pope&#8217;s person is sad stuff. Such lines as those on the
&#8220;yelping Mungril&#8221; (p. <a href="#Page_6">6</a>) serve only to show how squarely the &#8220;well-bred
Spaniels&#8221; taunt in the <i>Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot</i> had hit its target.
Hervey&#8217;s poem carried a prefatory letter headed &#8220;Mr. C&mdash;b&mdash;er to Mr. P.,&#8221;
making out that Cibber had a hand in writing the poem itself. Coming so
soon after Hervey&#8217;s <i>Letter to Cibber</i>, which had carried the markedly
intimate subscription &#8220;With the greatest Gratitude and Truth, most
affectionately yours,&#8221; this prefatory letter to the poem further
emphasized Hervey&#8217;s firm and deliberate alliance with Cibber.</p>

<p>Evidently it was the strangeness of this alliance between the two
opponents of Pope that struck the fancy of that unidentified &#8220;Scriblerus&#8221;
whose &#8220;Epistle to the Dunces,&#8221; <i>The Scribleriad</i>, was published between 30
September and 2 October 1742. When Hervey was &#8220;affectionately yours&#8221; to
Cibber, the two stood shoulder to shoulder so temptingly open to a single
volley that the author of <i>The Scribleriad</i> could fairly claim, as Pope
had claimed in the appendix to <i>The Dunciad Variorum</i> of 1729, that &#8220;the
<i>Poem was not made for these Authors, but these Authors for the Poem</i>.&#8221;
Hervey appears as &#8220;Narcissus,&#8221; the nickname Pope had used for him in <i>The
New Dunciad</i>. A &#8220;late Vice-Chamberlain&#8221; (because he had been dismissed
from that post in July 1742) still gorged with the fulsome dedication of
Conyers Middleton&#8217;s <i>Life of Cicero</i> (1741), he is shown (pp. <a href="#Page_11">11-13</a>)
rousing Cibber. Cibber&#8217;s situation, reclining on the lap of Dulness where
he is found by Hervey, is taken from <i>The New Dunciad</i>, while his general
Satanic role parallels Theobald&#8217;s in <i>The Dunciad Variorum</i>. This may
reflect common knowledge that Pope was at work on revisions that would
raise Cibber to the Dunces&#8217; throne, but the belief that Cibber was King of
the Dunces had been widespread from the date of his appointment as Poet
Laureate.<small><a name="f3.1" id="f3.1" href="#f3">[3]</a></small> <i>The Scribleriad</i> follows the general run of satires against
Cibber&mdash;attacking his senile infatuation for Peg Woffington, his violently
demagogic and chauvinistic <i>Nonjuror</i> (first acted in 1717 but still
drawing an audience in 1741), his laureate odes and his frank
commercialization of art.</p>

<p>Although the writer of <i>The Scribleriad</i> was obviously prompted by the
example of <i>The Dunciad</i> and borrows many details from Pope,<span class="pagenum">[Pg iii]</span> his poem has
very little of that mock-epic quality its title might lead a reader to
expect. There are slight traces of parody of Virgil when, on page <a href="#Page_16">16</a>,
Cibber appears as Aeneas (the character he was soon to assume in <i>The
Dunciad in Four Books</i>) and the epicene Hervey is portrayed as a
rejuvenated Sybil guiding the hero through a hell of duncery. There are
hints of <i>Paradise Lost</i> too, when Cibber, Satan-like, undertakes his
mission (p. <a href="#Page_17">17</a>) and the dunces, Belial-like, agree &#8220;they&#8217;re better in a
cursed State,/Than to be totally annihilate&#8221; (p. <a href="#Page_5">5</a>). But &#8220;Scriblerus&#8217;&#8221; use
of Virgil and Milton, unlike Pope&#8217;s, does not import some graver meaning
into his poem; it provides him with neither a framework of moral symbols
nor a continuous narrative thread.</p>

<p>The action is slight and its setting vague. Sometimes we are in a brothel,
crowded with bullies, punks, lords, draymen and linkboys, and managed by
Cibber (pp. <a href="#Page_11">11-12</a>) or by Dulness (p. <a href="#Page_10">10</a>). This setting, together with the
claim that Cibber&#8217;s own muse is a prostitute (p. <a href="#Page_8">8</a>), serves as a retort to
the Tom-Tit in the brothel story in Cibber&#8217;s <i>Letter to Pope</i> and to
emphasize the element of literary prostitution in the activities of Cibber
and his like. At other times the setting is a regular dunces&#8217; club (pp. <a href="#Page_9">9</a>,
<a href="#Page_16">16</a>) of the type chronicled in the pages of <i>The Grub Street Journal</i>.
Towards the end of the poem it is an Assembly Room (p. <a href="#Page_19">19</a>) presided over
by the Goddess of Puffs (a happy development of that more commonplace
mythical figure &#8220;Fame,&#8221; Dulness&#8217; handmaiden in <i>The New Dunciad</i>) who sets
a test for the dunces and judges their performance. Only in this
concluding episode can this rather shapeless poem (which certainly is
neither the mock epic nor the epistle that its title-page promises) be
assigned to any regular literary &#8220;kind.&#8221; This &#8220;kind&#8221; is that favorite of
the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the &#8220;Sessions Poem.&#8221;<small><a name="f4.1" id="f4.1" href="#f4">[4]</a></small></p>

<p>&#8220;Scriblerus&#8217;&#8221; account of the sessions of the dunces is more allusive and
particularized than the rest of the poem and consequently calls for
somewhat more detailed comment. The chief cases at the sessions embrace
the pamphlet battle of summer 1742 and theatrical rivalry in the 1741-42
London season. Cibber&#8217;s contribution to the paper-war, the <i>Letter to
Pope</i> (written according to Cibber &#8220;At the Desire of several Persons of
Quality&#8221;), is<span class="pagenum">[Pg iv]</span> introduced at page <a href="#Page_17">17</a> and consigned on page <a href="#Page_19">19</a> to William
Lewis its printer. Hervey stalks in &#8220;under VIRTUE&#8217;s Name&#8221; in a &#8220;borrow&#8217;d
Shape&#8221; (p. <a href="#Page_24">24</a>), an allusion to the suggestion in the prefatory epistle to
<i>The Difference between Verbal and Practical Virtue</i> that the poem was
Cibber&#8217;s work. (The &#8220;horse him&#8221; on <a href="#Page_25">25</a> of <i>The Scribleriad</i> refers to
Cibber&#8217;s adaptation of Shakespeare&#8217;s <i>Richard III.</i>) Other pamphlets
issued in August 1742 are mentioned on page <a href="#Page_24">24</a>&mdash;<i>Sawney and Colley</i>,<small><a name="f5.1" id="f5.1" href="#f5">[5]</a></small>
which &#8220;Scriblerus&#8221; calls &#8220;CLODDY&#8217;s Dialogue,&#8221; and <i>A Blast upon Bays</i>.<small><a name="f6.1" id="f6.1" href="#f6">[6]</a></small></p>

<p>Turning to the theatre, &#8220;Scriblerus&#8221; attacks all three major companies of
the 1741-42 London season. He first introduces the two patented theatres,
Drury Lane and Covent Garden, as rivals only in that debased dramatic form
the pantomime. &#8220;The angry <i>Quack</i>&#8221; (p. <a href="#Page_25">25</a>) is John Weaver, dancing master
at Drury Lane and author of <i>Anatomical and Mechanical Lectures upon
Dancing</i> (1721), who claimed for himself<small><a name="f7.1" id="f7.1" href="#f7">[7]</a></small> the credit of having
originated pantomime upon the English stage. Weaver&#8217;s <i>Orpheus and
Eurydice</i> at Drury Lane (1718) was hardly noticed, whereas John Rich had
more recently bestowed &#8220;an ORPHEUS on the Town&#8221; (p. <a href="#Page_25">25</a>) to very different
effect. Rich&#8217;s <i>Orpheus and Eurydice: With the Metamorphoses of Harlequin</i>
had opened on 12 February 1740 at Covent Garden, where he was manager.
With Rich himself as Harlequin, it was a wild success that
season&mdash;remaining a regular and highly popular afterpiece through the
1741-42 season and later.</p>

<p>What <i>The Scribleriad</i> tells us of &#8220;<i>Ambivius Turpio</i>, the Stage &#8217;Squire&#8221;
(p. <a href="#Page_26">26</a>) suggests that he is to be identified with Charles Fleetwood,
Esq.,<small><a name="f8.1" id="f8.1" href="#f8">[8]</a></small> the wealthy, inexperienced amateur who managed Drury Lane (this
even though the original Ambivius Turpio was an actor, while Fleetwood,
apparently, was not). All managers were frequently involved in disputes
over actors&#8217; pay, but Fleetwood&#8217;s were the most notorious. It was the
Drury Lane company that included &#8220;the contending POLLYS&#8221; (p. <a href="#Page_27">27</a>)&mdash;Mrs.
Cibber and Mrs. Clive who had bitterly quarrelled in 1736 over who should
play that role in <i>The Beggar&#8217;s Opera</i>. Fleetwood, like Rich, gave a play
for the benefit of Shakespeare&#8217;s monument in Westminster Abbey.<small><a name="f9.1" id="f9.1" href="#f9">[9]</a></small> What
little that Fleetwood knew of management he might well have learned from
his one-time under-manager Theophilus Cibber, the<span class="pagenum">[Pg v]</span> &#8220;young PTOLOMY&#8221; (p. <a href="#Page_27">27</a>)
who, of course, had derived his knowledge from his &#8220;great Sire alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The third theatre attacked in <i>The Scribleriad</i> is Goodman&#8217;s Fields. Its
manager, Henry Giffard, had no patent, but contrived to evade the
Licensing Act by the subterfuge of charging admission to a concert in two
parts and then offering, &#8220;gratis&#8221; in the interval, a regular full-length
play and afterpiece. The &#8220;City Wrath&#8221; (p. <a href="#Page_26">26</a>) arose from the fact that the
theatre was inside the City boundaries and was thought to encourage vice;
indeed, Sir John Barnard and his fellow aldermen managed to prevent it
opening for the 1742-43 season and thereafter. Allusions in the poem are
to the theatre&#8217;s highly successful 1741-42 season when Garrick sprang to
fame as Cibber&#8217;s Richard III and also played Tate&#8217;s King Lear. On page <a href="#Page_26">26</a>
&#8220;Scriblerus&#8221; sneers at Garrick&#8217;s small stature,<small><a name="f10.1" id="f10.1" href="#f10">[10]</a></small> and refers to the
impropriety of including the figure of Cato in the d&eacute;cor at Goodman&#8217;s
Fields.</p>

<p>Targets outside the three theatrical companies are chosen from among the
obvious ones already attacked by Pope. Mrs. Haywood, who in 1742 had
turned publisher under the sign of &#8220;Fame,&#8221; is shown (p. <a href="#Page_21">21</a>) appropriately
enough as the first dunce to recognize the Goddess of Puffs. &#8220;The Chief of
the translating Bards&#8221; (p. <a href="#Page_23">23</a>) is the aged and industrious Ozell, and his
fellows include Theobald and Thomas Cooke (p. <a href="#Page_24">24</a>).<small><a name="f11.1" id="f11.1" href="#f11">[11]</a></small> The satire extends
to touch the Administration and the City, with references to Britain&#8217;s
hitherto inactive part in the War of the Austrian Succession (p. <a href="#Page_9">9</a>) and to
the manner in which stock-jobbers used false war news to aid their
financial speculations (p. <a href="#Page_4">4</a>). It alludes to the &#8220;grand Debate&#8221; (p. <a href="#Page_8">8</a>) of
the committee set up in March 1742 to consider charges of corruption
against the deposed Walpole (created Lord Orford in February), which by
the end of the summer had fizzled out, doubtless because so many members
of the new government, including the numerous &#8220;Peers new-made&#8221; (p. <a href="#Page_9">9</a>), had
shared Walpole&#8217;s peculations and wished to cover their tracks. When it
hits at the King for his patronage of Cibber (p. <a href="#Page_13">13</a>), at the Queen for her
ridiculous Merlin&#8217;s Cave and waxworks in Richmond Gardens (p. <a href="#Page_16">16</a>),<small><a name="f12.1" id="f12.1" href="#f12">[12]</a></small> and
at the <i>Daily Gazeteer</i> which, until Walpole&#8217;s fall, had been expensively
subsidized from the government secret<span class="pagenum">[Pg vi]</span> service fund and had numbered among
its journalists such highly placed statesmen as Walpole&#8217;s brother
Horatio&mdash;then, <i>The Scribleriad</i> suggests, there is a general conspiracy
between high ranks and low to encourage Dulness. The Hervey-Cibber
alliance is merely the most recent manifestation of this conspiracy.</p>

<p>Although it so obviously arises immediately out of the pamphlet battle of
summer 1742, <i>The Scribleriad</i> manages to range more widely in its satire
than the anti-Pope lampoons it replies to. Further, it contrives to bring
in Pope himself without degrading him to the level of his antagonists.
This is done by mounting him on Pegasus and likening the dunces to curs
(pp. <a href="#Page_13">13-14</a>), or comparing him to the sun whose warmth hatches out maggots
(pp. <a href="#Page_6">6</a>, <a href="#Page_29">29</a>):</p>

<p class="poem">How many, who have Reams of Paper spoil&#8217;d,<br />
Have often sleepless Nights obscurely toil&#8217;d,<br />
And buried in their Eggs, like Silkworms, lay<br />
&#8217;Till his warm Satire shew&#8217;d them Life and Day?<br />
Here then, my Sons, is all your living Hope,<br />
To be immortal Scriblers, rail at POPE.</p>

<p>The image, the attitude and the phrasing alike are borrowed from Pope, for
<i>The Scribleriad</i> is highly derivative throughout. Only two or three times
does &#8220;Scriblerus&#8221; improve at all upon the many hints he steals from Pope.
I have already mentioned the Goddess Puffs, but other happy touches are to
be found in a spirited travesty (pp. <a href="#Page_16">16-17</a>) of the opening lines from
Ovid&#8217;s <i>Metamorphoses</i>, Book XIII:<small><a name="f13.1" id="f13.1" href="#f13">[13]</a></small></p>

When he, the Master of the Seven-fold Face,<br />
Rose gleaming thro&#8217; his own <i>Corinthian</i> Brass.</p>

<p>Pope had written in <i>The Dunciad Variorum</i>, &#8220;The heroes sit; the vulgar
form a ring&#8221; (II, 352), but one of the most memorable phrases in <i>The
Dunciad in Four Books</i> of 1743&mdash;the ingeniously insolent &#8220;sev&#8217;nfold Face&#8221;
(I, 244)&mdash;may well have been borrowed from <i>The<span class="pagenum">[Pg vii]</span> Scribleriad</i>. &#8220;Corinthian
Brass&#8221; is good also, economically combining as it does a hit against
Cibber&#8217;s effrontery and a hint of his sexual irregularities. Such strokes
of wit are rare; <i>The Scribleriad</i> is the work of a writer who in skill is
far closer to Grub Street than to Pope, but it may serve as &#8220;a voice from
the crowd&#8221; to remind us that Pope had his humbler literary supporters.</p>

<p>Have at you again, Sir. I gave you fair Warning that I would have the last
Word; and by &mdash;&mdash; (I will not swear in Print) you shall find me no Lyar. I
own, I am greatly elate on the Laurels the Town has bestow&#8217;d upon me for
my Victory over you in my Prose Combat; and, encouraged by that Triumph, I
now resolve to fight you on your own Dunghil of Poetry, and with your own
jingling Weapons of Rhyme and Metre. I confess I have had some Help; but
what then? since the greatest Princes are rather proud than asham&#8217;d of
Allies and Auxiliaries when they make War in the Field, why should I
decline such Assistance when I make War in the Press? And since you
thought most unrighteously and unjustly to fall upon me and crush me, only
because you imagin&#8217;d your Self strong and Me weak, as <i>France</i> fell upon
the Queen of <i>Hungary</i>; if I like her (<i>si parva licet componere magnis</i>)
by first striking a bold and desperate Stroke myself with a little
Success, have encouraged such a Friend to me, as <i>England</i> has been to
her, to espouse my Cause, and turn all the Weight of the War upon you,
till you wish you had never begun it; with what reasonable and equitable
Pleasure may I not pursue my Blow till I make you repent, by laying you on
your Back, the ungrateful Returns you have made me for saving you from
Destruction when you laid yourself on your Belly. I am, Sir, not your
humble, but your devoted Servant; for I will follow you as long as I live;
and as <i>Terence</i> says in the <i>Eunuch</i>, <i>Ego pol te pro istis dictis &amp;
factis, scelus, ulciscar, ut ne impune in nos illus eris</i>.</p>

Comparing how Men write, with how they act,<br />
How many Authors of this Contrast kind<br />
In ev&#8217;ry Age, and ev&#8217;ry Clime we find.<br />
Thus scribbling <i>P&mdash;&mdash;</i> who <i>Peter</i> never spares,<br />
Feeds on extortious Interest from young Heirs:<br />
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>And whilst he made Old <i>S&mdash;lkerk</i>&#8217;s Bows his Sport,<br />
Dawb&#8217;d minor Courtiers, of a minor Court.<br />
If <i>Sallust</i>, <i>Horace</i>, <i>Seneca</i>, and <i>He</i><br />
Thus in their Morals then so well agree;<br />
By what Ingredient is the Difference known?<br />
The Difference only in their Wit is shown,<br />
For all their Cant and Falshood is his own.<br />
He rails at Lies, and yet for half a Crown,<br />
Coins and disperses Lies thro&#8217; all the Town:<br />
Of his own Crimes the Innocent accuses,<br />
And those who clubb&#8217;d to make him eat, abuses.<br />
But whilst such Features in his Works we trace,<br />
And Gifts like these his happy Genius grace;<br />
Let none his haggard Face, or Mountain Back,<br />
The Object of mistaken Satire make;<br />
Faults which the best of Men, by Nature curs&#8217;d,<br />
May chance to share in common with the worst.<br />
In Vengeance for his Insults on Mankind,<br />
Let those who blame, some truer Blemish find,<br />
And lash that worse Deformity, his Mind.<br />
Like prudent Foes attack some weaker Part,<br />
And make the War upon his Head or Heart.<br />
Prove his late Works dishonest as they&#8217;re dull;<br />
That try&#8217;d by Moral or Poetic Rule,<br />
The Verdict must be either Knave or Fool.<br />
<small><a name="fl.1" id="fl.1" href="#fl">[l]</a></small>Whilst his false <i>English</i>, and false Facts combin&#8217;d,<br />
Betray the double Darkness of his Mind;<br />
<small><a name="fm.1" id="fm.1" href="#fm">[m]</a></small>That Mind so suited to its vile Abode,<br />
The Temple so adapted to the God,<br />
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>It seems the Counterpart by Heav&#8217;n design&#8217;d<br />
A Symbol and a Warning to Mankind:<br />
As at some Door we find hung out a Sign,<br />
Type of the Monster to be found within.<br />
From his own Words this Scoundrel let &#8217;em prove<br />
Unjust in Hate, incapable of Love;<br />
For all the Taste he ever has of Joy,<br />
Is like some yelping Mungril to annoy<br />
And teaze that Passenger he can&#8217;t destroy.<br />
To cast a Shadow o&#8217;er the spotless Fame,<br />
Or dye the Cheek of Innocence with Shame;<br />
To swell the Breast of Modesty with Care,<br />
Or force from Beauty&#8217;s Eye a secret Tear;<br />
And, not by Decency or Honour sway&#8217;d,<br />
Libel the Living, and asperse the Dead:<br />
Prone where he ne&#8217;er receiv&#8217;d to give Offence,<br />
But most averse to Merit and to Sense;<br />
Base to his Foe, but baser to his Friend,<br />
Lying to blame, and sneering to commend:<br />
Defaming those whom all but he must love,<br />
And praising those whom none but he approve.<br />
Then let him boast that honourable Crime,<br />
Of making those who fear not God, fear him;<br />
When the great Honour of that Boast is such<br />
That Hornets and Mad Dogs may boast as much.<br />
Such is th&#8217; Injustice of his daily Theme,<br />
And such the Lust that breaks his nightly Dream;<br />
That vestal Fire of undecaying Hate,<br />
Which Time&#8217;s cold Tide itself can ne&#8217;er abate,<br />
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span>But like <i>Domitian</i>, with a murd&#8217;rous Will,<br />
Rather than nothing, Flies he likes to kill.<br />
And in his Closet stabs some obscure Name,<br />
<small><a name="fn.1" id="fn.1" href="#fn">[n]</a></small>Brought by this Hangman first to Light and Shame.<br />
Such now his Works to all the World are known,<br />
Who undeceiv&#8217;d, their former Error own;<br />
Whilst not one Man who likes his rhyming Art,<br />
Allows him Genius, or defends his Heart:<br />
But thus from Triumph snatch&#8217;d, and giv&#8217;n to Shame<br />
Lash&#8217;d <i>into</i> Penitence, and <i>out</i> of Fame.<br />
Since all Mankind these certain Truths allow,<br />
And speak so freely what so well they know;<br />
No wonder doom&#8217;d such Treatment to receive,<br />
That he <i>can</i> feel, and that he <i>can&#8217;t</i> forgive.<br />
Were I dispos&#8217;d to curse the Man I hate,<br />
Such would I wish his miserable Fate.<br />
Thus striving to inflict, to meet Disgrace,<br />
And wasted to the Ghost of what he was;<br />
And like all Ghosts which Men of Sense despise,<br />
Only the Dread of Folly&#8217;s coward Eyes.<br />
Thus would I have him despicably live,<br />
Himself, his Friends, and Credit to survive,<br />
Into Contempt from Reputation hurl&#8217;d,<br />
His own Detractor thro&#8217; a scoffing World.</td></tr></table>
